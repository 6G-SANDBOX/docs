## Login

The API set forth in the TNLCM is as follows:

![api](./images/api.png)

If it is the first time using the API it is necessary to create a user:

![register](./images/register.png)

Once the user has been created or if it has been previously created, add the user and its password in the Basic Authorization section of the **Authorize** box:

![basicAuthorizarion](./images/basicAuthorizarion.png)

Once the user has been added, an access token and its refresh token can be generated. This access token has a duration of one day (can be modified):

![login](./images/login.png)

The next step is to add the token in the green **Authorize** box. It is required to put the word **Bearer**, a space and then the token. An example is shown:

![accessToken](./images/accessToken.png)

Now, requests that involve having an access token can be made.

If the access token expires, it can be refreshed by using the refresh token. The token in the green **Authorize** box must be updated with the refresh token and the post request must be made:

![refreshToken](./images/refreshToken.png)

When the request is made, it will return another access token that will need to be put back into the green **Authorize** box.

## Create trial network

Once logged into TNLCM, execute the POST request of the `trial-network` namespace:

![createTN](./images/createTN.png)

Fill in the following fields:

- `tn_id`: must start with a character and be at least 4 characters long. This field can be left blank, in which case a random value will be generated.
- `descriptor`: descriptor file containing the definition of the trial network. To create a descriptor file, refer to the [Trial Network Descriptor Schema](./descriptor-schema.mdx) section.
- `library_reference_type`: you can specify a branch, tag, or commit of the 6G-Library repository.
- `library_reference_value`: value corresponding to the type specified in the `library_reference_type` field.

## Deploy trial network

Once logged into TNLCM and the trial network has been created, execute the PUT request of the `trial-network` namespace:

![deployTN](./images/deployTN.png)

Fill in the following fields:

- `jenkins_deploy_pipeline`: if nothing is specified, a pipeline will be created inside the TNLCM folder in Jenkins with the name `TN_DEPLOY_<tn_id>`. If specified, it will be checked if it exists in Jenkins and that there is nothing queued to execute.
- `tn_id`: the identifier of the trial network received in the [POST request](#create-trial-network).

## Destroy trial network

Once logged into TNLCM, the trial network has been created and the trial network has been deployed, execute the DELETE request to destroy a trial network:

![destroyTN](./images/destroyTN.png)

Fill in the following fields:

- `jenkins_destroy_pipeline`: if nothing is specified, a pipeline will be created inside TNLCM folder in Jenkins with the name `TN_DESTROY_<tn_id>`. If specified, it will be checked if it exists in Jenkins and that there is nothing queued to execute.
- `tn_id`: the identifier of the trial network received in the [POST request](#create-trial-network).

## Purge trial network

Once logged into TNLCM, the trial network has been created, deployed and destroyed, execute the DELETE request to purge a trial network:

![purgeTN](./images/purgeTN.png)

Fill in the following fields:

- `tn_id`: the identifier of the trial network received in the [POST request](#create-trial-network).
