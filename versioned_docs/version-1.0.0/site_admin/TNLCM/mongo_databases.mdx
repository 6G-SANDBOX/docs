TNLCM database, created with MongoDB, consists of several collections that store important information about `trial network`, `resource_manager` and `user`. Below is a description of each collection, along with a graphical representation using SQL syntax created with <Link to={DBDIAGRAM}>dbdiagram.io</Link>.

## Collections

## Relationships

- `resource_manager.tn_id > trial_network.tn_id` // resource_manager references trial_network
- `trial_network.user_created > user.username` // A user can have multiple trial_networks (one-to-many)
