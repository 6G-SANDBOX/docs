import Link from "@docusaurus/Link";
import { ANSIBLE_INSTALLATION } from "@site/src/constants/v0.5.1";

## Requirements

To use the `ansible-vault` tool, the full *ansible* libraries and binaries are not needed. You can <Link to={ANSIBLE_INSTALLATION}>install ansible</Link> in your prefered way, but package `ansible-core` is enough.
If you do not wish to install *ansible* anywhere, remember it is already installed on the Jenkins VM so you can use it from there.

```bash
apt install ansible-core
```

## Work on your changes

Before you start working on your changes, switch to your branch using `git switch <site_name>`. 

Edit the `core.yaml` file using the password you created in the toolkit installer step using the following command:

```sh
ansible-vault edit <site_name>/core.yaml --vault-password-file=path/to/password.txt
```

where:
    - `<site_name>/core.yaml` is the path to the file you want to encrypt.
    - `--vault-password-file=path/to/password.txt` is the path containing the password.

Edit the contents of the `core.yaml` file.

Save the changes.

## Submit your changes

Once you're happy with your changes, stage them using:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit your changes using:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Push your changes to the repository using:

```bash
git push
```

The branch must include the **directory** with the same branch name and with the **core.yaml** file.
