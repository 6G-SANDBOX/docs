# Swagger UI

## Login

The API set forth in the TNLCM is as follows:

![Swagger API](./images/tnlcm_swagger.png)

If it is the first time using the API it is necessary to create a user:

![Register Endpoint](./images/tnlcm_register.png)

Once the user has been created or if it has been previously created, add the user and its password in the Basic Authorization section of the **Authorize** box:

![Basic Authorizarion](./images/tnlcm_basic_auth.png)

Once the user has been added, an access token and its refresh token can be generated. This access token has a duration of one day (can be modified):

![Login Endpoint](./images/tnlcm_login.png)

The next step is to add the token in the green **Authorize** box. It is required to put the word **Bearer**, a space and then the token. An example is shown:

![Token Authentication](./images/tnlcm_token_auth.png)

Now, requests that involve having an access token can be made.

If the access token expires, it can be refreshed by using the refresh token. The token in the green **Authorize** box must be updated with the refresh token and the post request must be made:

![Refresh Token Endpoint](./images/tnlcm_refresh_token.png)

When the request is made, it will return another access token that will need to be put back into the green **Authorize** box.


## Create a Trial Network inside TNLCM

Once logged into TNLCM, execute the POST request of the `trial-network` namespace:

![TNs POST Endpoint](./images/tnlcm_tn_create.png)

Fill in the following fields:

- `tn_id`: must start with a character and be at least 4 characters long. This field can be left blank, in which case a random value will be generated.
- `descriptor`: descriptor file containing the definition of the trial network. To create a descriptor file, refer to the [Trial Network Descriptor Schema](./descriptor.mdx) section.
- `library_reference_type`: you can specify a branch, tag, or commit of the <Link to={LIBRARY_REPO_URL}>6G-Library</Link> repository.
- `library_reference_value`: value corresponding to the type specified in the `library_reference_type` field.

### Response

- **HTTP Code:** `200 OK`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Description:** A successful request returns information about the validated trial network.
