## :wave: Welcome, Trial Network User

As a user, you‚Äôve been granted access to a **Trial Network (TN)** that has already been deployed by an experimenter. This guide explains how to connect to and use the TN for your testing or research.

You should have received a **report file** (typically in Markdown) from the experimenter. This file includes everything you need to access the network: VPN configuration, SSH credentials, IP addresses, and service info.

---

## üîê Connect to the VPN

To access the Trial Network, you need to establish a VPN tunnel using **WireGuard**.

You should have received a config file named something like `wg_client0.conf` or similar, containing a section like this:

```toml
[Interface]
Address = 10.7.0.2/24
DNS = 192.168.199.1
PrivateKey = <your-private-key>

[Peer]
PublicKey = <server-public-key>
PresharedKey = <psk>
AllowedIPs = 192.168.199.0/24
Endpoint = <server-ip>:<port>
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps to connect

1. Install [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) on your machine.
2. Save the provided configuration to a file (e.g. `wg_client0.conf`).
3. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo wg-quick up wg_client0
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Only one person can use a given VPN client at a time. If you're sharing this with others, coordinate with your team.

## üñ• Accessing Virtual Machines (VMs)

Once connected via VPN, you can access the virtual machines in the Trial Network using **SSH**.

You should have received a **private SSH key** (typically in OpenSSH format), along with a suggested file name and permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/misc-<tn_name>-id_ed25519
```

Use the following command to connect:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/misc-<tn_name>-id_ed25519 tnuser@<vm_ip>
```

You‚Äôll find the list of available VM IPs in the report file, under a section like:

```json
{
  "1271": "192.168.199.2"
}
```

---

## üß≠ DNS and Services

Some Trial Networks include an internal DNS server (e.g., **Technitium**) to resolve component names or access portals.

You may find in your report a link like:

```
http://bastion.<tn_name>.6gsandbox.uma.internal:5380
```

and credentials like:

- **user**: `admin`  
- **password**: `...`

You can use this DNS interface to inspect name resolutions within the network.

## üì¶ What you typically receive

A Trial Network user will usually receive:

| Item                       | Purpose                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `wg_client0.conf`          | VPN config to access the TN                  |
| Private SSH key            | Connect securely to VMs inside the TN        |
| VM IPs & component list    | To know what‚Äôs running and where             |
| DNS portal URL & creds     | Optional, for internal name resolution       |
| Markdown report            | Full overview of the Trial Network           |

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

- ‚ùå **Can‚Äôt connect via VPN?**  
  Make sure no one else is using your config at the same time.

- ‚ùå **Permission denied (SSH)?**  
  Double-check key permissions and SSH user (`tnuser`).

- ‚ùå **DNS names not resolving?**  
  You may need to configure your system to use the internal DNS via the WireGuard config.

## üì¨ Need help?

Contact the **experimenter** who shared the Trial Network with you. They can clarify details or regenerate access credentials if needed.

Happy experimenting üöÄ
