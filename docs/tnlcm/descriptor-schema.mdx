:::warning
The format of Trial Network Descriptors has not been finalized and may change in the future.
:::

Trial Network Descriptors are yaml files with a set of expected fields and with the following structure:

```yaml
trial_network: # Mandatory, contains the description of all entities in the Trial Network
  type-name: # Mandatory, entity name. Unique identifier for each entity in the Trial Network
    type: # Mandatory, 6G-Library component type
    name: # Mandatory, custom name. Not use character \- or \. Exclude components tn_init, tn_bastion and tn_vxlan
    debug: # Optional, param to debug component in Jenkins. Possible values true or false
    dependencies: # Mandatory, list of dependencies of the component with other components
      - type-name
      - ...
    input: # Mandatory, dictionary with the variables collected from the input part of the 6G-Library
      key: value
```

The TNLCM repository contains some advanced descriptors. Access the <Link to={TNLCM_BACKEND_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTORS_README}>documentation</Link> to see what is defined in each of them.

- <Link to={TNLCM_BACKEND_ELCM_TRIAL_NETWORK}>elcm_loadcore_open5gs_vm</Link> - **should work on all platforms**. Reference trial network defined for experimentation.
- <Link to={TNLCM_BACKEND_LOADCORE_TRIAL_NETWORK}>loadcore_open5gs_vm</Link> - **should work on all platforms**. Reference trial network defined in WP5.

:::note
Each component in the <Link to={LIBRARY_REPO_URL}>6G-Library</Link> has a descriptor and a readme defined to understand how it works.
