## Set up your environment

### Fork the repository

Fork the project to your GitHub account to have your own copy. To do this, click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

<CodeBlock>
  {`${DOCS_REPO_URL}`}
</CodeBlock>

### Clone your fork

After forking, clone the repository to your local machine. To do this, copy the URL of your fork by clicking the green "Code" button.

```bash
git clone <URL of your fork>
```

### Add the original repository as a remote

To keep your fork updated with changes from the original repository, add the original repository as a remote.

```bash
git remote add upstream <URL of the original repository>
```

## Add new section to the documentation

To add a new section to the documentation, follow these steps:

### Create a branch from `develop`

- The branch name should follow the format `feature/<section_name>`.
- The `<section_name>` should be meaningful.

```bash
git switch -c feature/<section_name> develop
```

### Create a directory inside the [`docs`](./docs/) directory

- The name of the directory must be `<section_name>`.
- If the directory name requires spaces, separate words using **-**.

### Add files to the new directory `<section_name>`

- Include a `_category_.json` file with the following structure:

```json title="<section_name>/_category_.json"
{
  "position": <next_position>,
  "label": "<section_name>",
  "collapsible": true,
  "collapsed": true,
  "className": "red",
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "title": "<section_name> Overview"
  },
  "customProps": {
    "description": ""
  }
}
```

- Add as many markdown files as required for the new documentation section. Each markdown file must begin with the following structure:

```markdown title="<section_name>/<file_name>.mdx"
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: "<title>"
sidebar_label: "<sidebar_label>"
draft: false
---
```

- The first heading level in the markdown file should be **##**. Please avoid using **#**.
- If the markdown file name requires spaces, separate words using **-**.
- If the documentation requires images, create a directory named `images` inside the `<section_name>` directory.

git add .
git commit -m "Add new <section_name> section to the documentation"
```

### Push the changes to your fork

```bash

```

### Create a pull request on GitHub

- The pull request must include:
  - The **new section directory** inside docs directory.
  - The **images of the new section** inside `<section_name>` directory (if required).

Once the pull request has been reviewed, the changes will be merged into the `develop` branch of the original repository.
