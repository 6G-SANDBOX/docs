## Introduction

Welcome to the **6G-Sandbox Site Administrators** section. This documentation is intended for the technical teams responsible for setting up, managing, and maintaining the infrastructure and services of a 6G-Sandbox site.

### Role of a Site Administrator

Site administrators play a critical role in ensuring the successful deployment and operation of each 6G-Sandbox site. Their responsibilities span multiple layers of the system, from infrastructure provisioning to service orchestration and support for experimentation workflows.

Key duties include:

- **Infrastructure Deployment**: Use the [Toolkit Installer](./toolkit.mdx) to automate the installation of essential components like OpenNebula (cloud management), MinIO (object storage), Jenkins (CI/CD), TNLCM (Trial Network Lifecycle Manager), DNS and Route Manager.
  
- **System Configuration & Maintenance**: Configure networking (VLAN/VXLAN), storage backends (e.g., Ceph), and compute nodes to meet the minimum requirements defined by the project. Ensure that all components are properly interconnected and resilient.
  
- **Secure Access & Secrets Management**: Handle sensitive configuration files such as `core.yaml` using tools like `ansible-vault`, and manage credentials and tokens required for site operations and repository access.
  
- **Component Integration Support**: Assist experimenters and developers in deploying components from the <Link to={LIBRARY_REPO_URL}>6G-Library</Link> by providing stable, correctly configured environments and resolving site-specific issues.

- **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**: Oversee the health of deployed services, analyze pipeline executions in Jenkins, and provide first-line support for deployments within the site.
