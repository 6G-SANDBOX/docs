## Introduction

Welcome to the **6G-Sandbox Component Developers** section. This documentation is intended for developers who want to contribute reusable infrastructure or service components to be deployed within Trial Networks (TNs) in the 6G-SANDBOX project.

As a Component Developer, your role is to design, implement, and integrate components that will be deployed automatically by the 6G-Sandbox orchestration stack, using **TNLCM**, **Jenkins**, **Ansible**, and **Terraform**.

Your work feeds directly into the <Link to={LIBRARY_REPO_URL}>GitHub repository</Link>, where all component definitions, inputs, playbooks, and templates are maintained.


## What You’ll Do

Component Developers are responsible for:

- 📦 **Creating new components** inside the <Link to={LIBRARY_REPO_URL}>GitHub repository</Link>. You can use `.dummy_component/` as a base.
- 🛠️ **Defining Ansible playbooks** that implement the provisioning and configuration logic for your component.
- ⚙️ **Leveraging Terraform and Helm** to ensure reproducible deployments.
- 📤 **Publishing results and outputs** to MinIO.
- 🔁 **Handling dependencies** between components through shared variable files and terraform outputs.

## What's in This Section

This section walks you through everything you need to build and deliver a component:

- 📚 [6G-Library Structure](./6g_library.mdx): Understand how components are defined and how TNLCM and Jenkins interact with the repository.
- 🧩 [Playbook Development Guide](./playbook_deployment_guide.mdx): Learn how to build robust, idempotent, multi-stage Ansible playbooks.
- 🖥️ [Appliances](./appliances.mdx): Build preconfigured VM images to be used in your components.
- 🛒 [Marketplace](./6gsandbox_marketplace.mdx): Learn how appliances are shared across sites via a distributed appliance marketplace.
- 🧪 [Deploy your own AppMarket](./deploy_appmarket.mdx): Spin up your own appliance marketplace instance for local testing.
