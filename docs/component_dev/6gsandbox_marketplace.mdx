## Welcome to the 6G-SANDBOX Marketplace

The **6G-SANDBOX Marketplace** is a shared catalog of reusable **appliances** (prebuilt virtual machine images) that can be used to compose and deploy Trial Networks (TNs) across the 6G-SANDBOX infrastructure.

These appliances act as ready-to-use building blocks for common services and components, such as TNLCM, VPN bastions, databases, 5G cores, and more.


## What is an appliance?

An appliance is a preconfigured virtual machine image that encapsulates a software service, runtime environment, or utility.

For example:

- A VPN gateway with WireGuard and DNS
- A container runtime host
- A 5G core stack (e.g., Open5GCore)
- A monitoring or logging server

These appliances are portable and reproducible, and can be deployed as components inside a Trial Network via the 6G Library and TNLCM.


## Why use the Marketplace?

Using Marketplace appliances ensures:

- **Consistency** across sites and deployments
- **Reusability** of complex environments
- **Automation** of provisioning and configuration
- **Traceability** via versioned metadata

They make the process of deploying TNs faster, safer, and easier to maintain.
