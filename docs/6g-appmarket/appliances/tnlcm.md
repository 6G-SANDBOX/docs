**[TNLCM](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/TNLCM)** has been designed as a modular application, with the intention of making certain components easily replaceable or extended, while minimizing the effect of changes in other parts of the application. At the same time, there is an emphasis on re-usability, where several data structures and generic logic can be shared between the different components of the application.
