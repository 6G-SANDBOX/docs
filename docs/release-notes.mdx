#### :brain: **TNLCM backend v0.5.0**

:link: **Repository:** <Link to={TNLCM_BACKEND_REPO_URL}>6G-SANDBOX/TNLCM</Link>

:page_facing_up: **Changelog:** [TNLCM Release Notes](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/TNLCM/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

#### :wrench: **Toolkit Installer v0.5.0**

:link: **Repository:** <Link to={TOOLKIT_INSTALLER_REPO_URL}>6G-SANDBOX/toolkit-installer</Link>

:page_facing_up: **Changelog:** [Toolkit Installer Release Notes](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/toolkit-installer/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

For the toolkit installer to work perfectly, a modification is required in the `/usr/lib/one/ruby/cli/one_helper.rb` file on the OpenNebula frontend, following the instructions from this [commit](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/commit/73447d69021db71c2202dc78a0098d1563bf258f). This change will take effect in OpenNebula version 7.0.

To install the new version of the toolkit installer, follow the instructions [here](./toolkit-installer/installation.mdx).

#### :books: **6G-Library v0.5.0**

:link: **Repository:** <Link to={LIBRARY_REPO_URL}>6G-SANDBOX/6G-Library</Link>

:page_facing_up: **Changelog:** [6G-Library Release Notes](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/6G-Library/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

#### **Appliances**

If you have an appliance that belongs to the <Link to={MARKETPLACE_URL}>6G-SANDBOX Marketplace</Link>, you need to add attributes to its images.

**If the appliance is an image type**

1. Access the OpenNebula frontend.
2. Create a file without an extension with the following content:

```text
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_NAME="<appliance_name>"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_VERSION="<XXXXXXXX-XXXX>"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_SOFTWARE_VERSION="<vX.X.X>"
```

The field values can be obtained either from the marketplace or by using the following curl command:

```bash
curl https://marketplace.mobilesandbox.cloud:9443/appliance/<name> -H "Accept: application/json"
```

For example, for the `ELCM` appliance, the command would be:

```bash
curl https://marketplace.mobilesandbox.cloud:9443/appliance/service_ELCM -H "Accept: application/json"
```

After executing the curl command, you will receive a JSON response with the following information:

```json
{
    "_id":{"$oid":"service_ELCM"},
    "links":{"download":{"href":"https://marketplace.mobilesandbox.cloud:9443/appliance/service_ELCM/download"}},
    "name":"ELCM",
    "version":"v3.7.1-20250303-1420",
    "publisher":"University of Malaga",
    ...
}
```

Next, the values you need to add to the file are:

- `<appliance_name>` is the value of the `name` field from the curl response (e.g., `ELCM` has name `ELCM`).
- `<XXXXXXXX-XXXX>` is the second part of the `version` field. The `version` field follows the format `vX.X.X-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` and you should add the second part (e.g., `ELCM` has version `v3.7.1-20250303-1420`, so you should add `20250303-1420`).
- `<vX.X.X>` is the first part of the `version` field. The `version` field follows the format `vX.X.X-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` and you should add the first part (e.g., `ELCM` has version `v3.7.1-20250303-1420`, so you should add `v3.7.1`).

So the file for the `ELCM` appliance would look like this:

```text
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_NAME="ELCM"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_VERSION="20250303-1420"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_SOFTWARE_VERSION="v3.7.1"
```

3. Execute the following command to add the attributes to an image:

```bash
oneimage update <image_id> --append <path_to_file>
```

Where:

- `<image_id>` is the ID of the image in OpenNebula to which you want to add the attributes.
- `<path_to_file>` is the path to the file you created in step 2.

For the `ELCM` appliance, the command would be:

```bash
oneimage update <image_elcm_id> --append <path_to_file>
```

**If the appliance is a service type**

This applies to appliances such as `6G-Sandbox Toolkit` or `oneKE`. The steps are as follows:

1. Access the OpenNebula frontend.
2. Create a file without an extension with the following content:

```text
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_NAME="<appliance_name>"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_VERSION="<XXXXXXXX-XXXX>"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_SOFTWARE_VERSION="<vX.X.X>"
```

The field values can be obtained either from the marketplace or using curl. For example, for `6G-Sandbox Toolkit`, the command would be:

```bash
curl https://marketplace.mobilesandbox.cloud:9443/appliance/service_toolkit -H "Accept: application/json"
```

After executing the curl command, you will receive a JSON response with the following information:

```json
{
    "_id":{"$oid":"service_toolkit"},
    "links":{"download":{"href":"https://marketplace.mobilesandbox.cloud:9443/appliance/service_toolkit/download"}},
    "name":"6G-Sandbox Toolkit",
    "version":"v0.4.0-20250219-2235",
    "publisher":"Telefonica Innovacion Digital",
    ...
}
```

Next, the values you need to add to the file are:

- `<appliance_name>` is the value of the `name` field from the curl response (e.g., `6G-Sandbox Toolkit` has name `6G-Sandbox Toolkit`).
- `<XXXXXXXX-XXXX>` is the second part of the `version` field. The `version` field follows the format `vX.X.X-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` and you should add the second part (e.g., `6G-Sandbox Toolkit` has version `v0.4.0-20250219-2235`, so you should add `20250219-2235`).
- `<vX.X.X>` is the first part of the `version` field. The `version` field follows the format `vX.X.X-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` and you should add the first part (e.g., `6G-Sandbox Toolkit` has version `v0.4.0-20250219-2235`, so you should add `v0.4.0`).

So the file for the `6G-Sandbox Toolkit` appliance would look like this:

```text
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_NAME="6G-Sandbox Toolkit"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_VERSION="20250219-2235"
ONE_6GSB_MARKETPLACE_APPLIANCE_SOFTWARE_VERSION="v0.4.0"
```

3. Execute the following command to add the attributes. For each image in the service, execute the following command:

```bash
oneimage update <image_id> --append <path_to_file>
```

Where:

- `<image_id>` is the ID of the image in OpenNebula to which you want to add the attributes.
- `<path_to_file>` is the path to the file you created in step 2.

For the `6G-Sandbox Toolkit` appliance, the command would be:

```bash
oneimage update <image_jenkins_id> --append <path_to_file>
oneimage update <image_tnlcm_id> --append <path_to_file>
oneimage update <image_minio_disk0_id> --append <path_to_file>
oneimage update <image_minio_disk1_id> --append <path_to_file>
```

Once the previous steps are completed, proceed with the update. The following appliances from <Link to={MARKETPLACE_URL}>6G-SANDBOX Marketplace</Link> have been updated:

| Software             | Previous Version        | New Version                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 6G-Sandbox Toolkit   | v0.4.0-20250219-2235    | v0.5.0-20250403-1109             |
| ELCM                 | v3.7.1-20250303-1420    | v3.7.1-20250331-1449             |
| UERANSIM             | v3.2.6-20250206-1135    | v3.2.7-20250331-1350             |
| oneKE                | v1.29                   | 1.31.3-6.10.0-2-20250220-0051    |

You can download or upgrade the appliances using the <Link to={TOOLKIT_INSTALLER_REPO_URL}>toolkit installer</Link> or doing it manually. If you want to do it manually, remember to add the attributes to the images as explained above and update the <Link to={SITES_REPO_URL}>6G-Sandbox-Sites</Link> repository.
