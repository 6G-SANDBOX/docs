## :satellite: **What is 6G-SANDBOX?**

6G-SANDBOX is a Horizon Europe funded research project that aims to support for the next decade technology and research validation processes needed in the pathway towards 6G.

It offers distributed testbeds, tools, and services to support researchers, developers, and industry players in building and evaluating new 6G components and use cases.

One of the core capabilities of 6G-SANDBOX is the ability to design, deploy, and manage trial networksâ€”temporary, isolated network environments used to validate and test new 6G technologies,
architectures, and services in controlled conditions. These trial networks provide a flexible, reproducible, and safe experimentation space, enabling stakeholders to evaluate innovations before
integrating them into production or larger-scale deployments.


## :building_construction: **What is a Trial Network (TN)?**

A **Trial Network** (TN) is a temporary, isolated 5G and 6G infrastructure built for experimentation purposes. It consists of interconnected components deployed across one or more physical sites.

Trial Networks enable:

- Realistic experimentation in distributed testbeds
- Safe testing of early-stage 5G and 6G technologies
- Custom environments per use case or experiment

They are fully managed through TNLCM.


## :gear: **What is TNLCM?**

The **Trial Network Lifecycle Manager (TNLCM)** is the central backend system responsible for:

- Creating, validating, and deploying trial networks
- Managing configuration, lifecycle and logs
- Coordinating with other modules like the 6G Library and Sandbox Sites

> Basic interactions with the TNLCM can be performed from its Frontend, but more experienced users might want to delve into its REST API or CLI tools.


## :hammer_and_wrench: **Main Repositories**

The 6G Sandbox project can be separated in multiple Main repositories:
{/* TODO: Add the links to each repo using constant vars*/}
- **6G Library**: The main repository of the available Trial Network components.
- **6G-Sandbox-Sites**: Encrypted storage of site-specific configuration variables for deployments.
- **TNLCM** (*Trial Network Lifecycle Manager*): Manages the complete lifecycle of the Trial Network.
- **TNLCM-FRONTEND** (*Trial Network Lifecycle Manager*): Manages the complete lifecycle of the Trial Network.
- **Toolkit Installer**: Automates the setup of TNLCM, Jenkins, and MinIO in new sites.
- **Marketplace Community**: Code used to build and publish the preconfigured VM images available in the 6G-Sandbox Marketplace.

Each module plays a role in enabling scalable, flexible, and repeatable 5G/6G experimentation.

## :busts_in_silhouette: **User profiles and usage paths**

According to your role and needs, you can interact with 6G-Sandbox in different ways. Here are the main user profiles and their typical usage paths:

- **Experimenter**:  
  Uses 6G-Sandbox to deploy Trial Networks and perform experiments.

- **Site Administrator**:  
  Manages the underlying infrastructure and ensures the availability of resources for trial networks. Handles the list of components that can be used in trial networks in its site. 

- **Component Developer**:
  Develops new 6G Library components or updates existing ones, ensuring they are compatible with the TNLCM and can be used in trial networks.
