## :satellite: **What is 6G-SANDBOX?**

6G-SANDBOX is a Horizon Europe funded research project that aims to support for the next decade technology and research validation processes needed in the pathway towards 6G.

It offers distributed testbeds, tools, and services to support researchers, developers, and industry players in building and evaluating new 6G components and use cases.

One of the core capabilities of 6G-SANDBOX is the ability to design, deploy, and manage trial networks—temporary, isolated network environments used to validate and test new 6G technologies,
architectures, and services in controlled conditions. These trial networks provide a flexible, reproducible, and safe experimentation space, enabling stakeholders to evaluate innovations before
integrating them into production or larger-scale deployments.


## :building_construction: **What is a Trial Network (TN)?**

A **Trial Network** (TN) is a temporary, isolated 5G and 6G infrastructure built for experimentation purposes. It consists of interconnected components deployed across one or more physical sites.

Trial Networks enable:

- Realistic experimentation in distributed testbeds
- Safe testing of early-stage 5G and 6G technologies
- Custom environments per use case or experiment

They are fully managed through TNLCM.


## :gear: **What is TNLCM?**

The **Trial Network Lifecycle Manager (TNLCM)** is the central backend system responsible for:

- Creating, validating, and deploying trial networks
- Managing configuration, lifecycle and logs
- Coordinating with other modules like the 6G Library and Sandbox Sites

> All interactions with TNLCM are performed through its REST API or via CLI tools built on top of it.


## :hammer_and_wrench: **Core components**

The platform is composed of modular systems:

- **TNLCM** (Trial Network Lifecycle Manager): Manages the complete lifecycle of a Trial Network.
- **6G Library**: Repository of deployable 6G components and blueprints.
- **6G Library**: A catalog of available resources, components and blueprints.
- **6G-Sandbox-Sites**: Holds site-specific configuration variables for deployments.
- **Toolkit Installer**: Automates the setup of TNLCM, Jenkins, and MinIO in new sites.
- **Marketplace Community**: Public catalog of reusable experimental assets.

Each module plays a role in enabling scalable, flexible, and repeatable 5G/6G experimentation.

## :busts_in_silhouette: **User profiles and usage paths**

Depending on your role, you might interact with different parts of the system:

- **Component Developer**:  
  Define or update components in the 6G Library  
  → Start with: [6G-Library](./6g-library/home)

- **Experimenter**:  
  Use TNLCM to create, deploy, and manage trial networks  
  → Start with: [TNLCM](./tnlcm/home)

- **User**:  
  Consume a deployed trial network for testing or research  
  → Start with: [Accessing Trial Networks](./tnlcm/access-tn)

- **Site Admin**:  
  Configure infrastructure and maintain site environments  
  → Start with: [6G-Sandbox-Sites](./6g-sandbox-sites/home)


## :rocket: **Get started**
